# Autism_Spectrum_Disorder

Understanding and detecting Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is of significant importance because timely detection can lead to better intervention and more support for individuals with autism, improving their overall quality of life. However, diagnosing ASD is can be challenging, due to the reason that it involves complex behavioral assessments performed by experienced clinicians. A preliminary assessment done via a machine learning model can provide people with an quick indication on if they should pursue a more extensive assessment. Allowing them to make decisions earlier in their lives.

Dataset: [Autism Screening Adult Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/426/autism+screening+adult)


This dataset contains 21 attributes, a mix of binary questions based on behavioural aspects and personal characteristics such as age, gender, and ethnicity. The target attribute is the classification of the individual, whether they fall under the autism spectrum or not.
This project will aim to use the provided dataset to train a classification machine learning model to predict whether an adult is likely to have ASD. In general, a model that can accomplish this can be beneficial in identifying individuals with ASD early and using that information to provide any support they may need (such as more detailed assessments).
